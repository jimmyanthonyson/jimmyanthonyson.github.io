    <h3>
        Hello, ladies, look at your man, now back to me, 
        now back at your man, now back to me. Sadly, he 
        isn’t me, but if he stopped using ladies scented 
        body wash and switched to Old Spice, he could 
        smell like he’s me. Look down, back up, where 
        are you? You’re on a boat with the man your man 
        could smell like. What’s in your hand, back at me. 
        I have it, it’s an oyster with two tickets to 
        that thing you love. Look again, the tickets are 
        now diamonds. Anything is possible when your man 
        smells like Old Spice and not a lady. I’m on a horse.
    </h3>
